                <p>Kaduru and Ruk Attana woods are used to carve the masks. After  
                the tree has been cut down, the tree should be exposed to the sun to dry 
                thoroughly. After drying, carving begins using special tools designed for carving wood, 
                such as taphole handsaws, planers, hand files, hammers and mallets. Never met mechanical 
                equipment in the history of masks in Sri Lanka. All  work is done by hand. This is the main 
                reason why masks attract attention alongside other arts. After carving, the  ancient creators 
                used paint made from herbal plants to draw patterns onto the mask to pop facial reactions on 
                the mask. It has been. Finally, a clear lacquer-like paint that is resistant to scratches and 
                insects is applied to protect these masks.</p>

            <h1>Painting Mask</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Traditional Sri Lankan masks are often brightly colored and depict gods, demons,
            animals, or other figures from mythology. You can research traditional designs online
            or come up with your own unique design. For that we have to use some tools like brushes of various sizes and sand paper.
            To paint a mask we should have a idea and design. </p><br>
            <div class="list">
                <p >Here at follow there are major steps how to paint the mask.<hr></p>
           
           
            <ul>
                <li>If you are using a wooden mask, sand it lightly to smooth out any rough edges or imperfections.</li>
                <li>Once you have your design planned out, start sketching it onto the mask using a pencil.</li>
                <li>Use masking tape to block off areas you don't want to paint, if desired.</li>
                <li>Begin painting the mask using your brushes and acrylic paint. You can mix colors on your palette or plate to create the shades you need.</li>
                <li>Allow the paint to dry completely before removing the masking tape, if you used masking tape.</li>
                <li>Once the paint is dry, you can add any additional details or accents using smaller brushes and finer lines.</li>
                <li>When you are satisfied with your finished mask, allow it to dry completely before handling or displaying it.</li>

            <h1>Dance With Mask</h1>
            
            <p>The “Devil Dances” are an attempt to respond to the common belief that certain ailments are caused by unseen hands and 
            that they should be chased away for the patient to get cured. If an individual or a family is not doing well, the village-folk
            believe that it’s because that person or the family is being harassed by unseen hands. A ‘thovil’ ceremony is the answer.

            The ‘thovil’ can be a simple ritualistic ceremony at home restricted to family and immediate neighbors or involving the whole village 
            like the ‘gam-maduva’ or the ‘devol-maduva’ which is closely linked to the worship of gods. Masked dancers take part in at least two of 
            the well-known ‘thovil’ ceremonies referred to as the ‘Maha Sohon Samayama’ and the ‘Gara Yakuma’. The mention of ‘Maha Sohona’ frightens 
            the people since he is believed to be the demon of the graveyards.

            The performer disguises himself as a bear and wears a mask and a dress to resemble one. Often the ‘thovil’ involves the ‘sanni’ dances 
            where all the dancers wear masks. The ‘daha ata sanniya’ refers to sixteen ailments with a demon being responsible for each one of them.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>Dancers wearing masks take part in processions while at certain ceremonies, masks are used to depict different characters. Of later origin 
          are the masks worn by children and teenagers at street performances during Vesak. Popularly known as ‘olu bakko’ for the simple reason that oversize
          masks are worn, these performances keep the younger-folk, in particular, entertained.

          The simple version of the devil dance ritual usually starts in the morning with the building of the stage, decorations and preparation of the costumes. 
          The performers build an intricate stage before which the dancing commences. The stage consists of a wall made of freshly cut natural materials such as 
          coconut palm tree and banana tree trunks. Depending on the region and the available materials the stage may also be coated with clay mud. The dances are 
          accompanied by drummers which also herald the begin of the ritual. The distinctive sound ensures all neighbors turn up to take part. The full ritual usually 
          lasts until the morning, with the dancers consuming betel-nut juice and drinking coke to stay awake. Dances can however also go on for multiple days.</p>
